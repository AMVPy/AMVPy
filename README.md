We are developing a python package (AMV-Py: Collection of Python Scripts) that assist in magnetotelluric (MT) data imaging, analysis and handling data sets for modelling and inversion. MT is a powerful geophysical tool used for several subsurface investigations such as in groundwater, geothermal, volcanology and tectonics.
